# Azure DevOps Pipeline Status

## Current Status: ‚ö†Ô∏è Waiting for Parallelism Approval

### Issue Encountered:
```
##[error]No hosted parallelism has been purchased or granted. 
To request a free parallelism grant, please fill out the following form 
https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request
```

### Solutions Available:

#### ‚úÖ GitHub Actions (Active Alternative)
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Ready to use immediately
- **Location**: https://github.com/MarioH88/devops.git
- **Workflow File**: `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`
- **Features**: Same CI/CD capabilities as Azure DevOps

#### ‚è≥ Azure DevOps (Pending Approval)
- **Action Required**: Submit parallelism request form
- **Timeline**: 2-3 business days
- **Form**: https://aka.ms/azpipelines-parallelism-request

#### üéØ Demo Strategy

**For Immediate Demo**:
1. Use GitHub Actions to show CI/CD pipeline
2. Demonstrate the same DevOps practices
3. Show Azure DevOps configuration (even if not running)
4. Explain the parallelism limitation as a real-world scenario

**Demo Talking Points**:
- "This is a common limitation with new Azure DevOps organizations"
- "In enterprise environments, parallelism is typically pre-configured"
- "GitHub Actions provides the same DevOps capabilities"
- "The pipeline configuration is portable between platforms"

### GitHub Actions Workflow Summary

Our `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml` includes:
- ‚úÖ Python 3.11 setup
- ‚úÖ Dependency installation
- ‚úÖ Code linting with flake8
- ‚úÖ Security scanning with bandit
- ‚úÖ Unit testing with pytest
- ‚úÖ Coverage reporting
- ‚úÖ Docker image building
- ‚úÖ Container security scanning

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Use GitHub Actions for demo
2. **Submit**: Azure DevOps parallelism request
3. **Future**: Switch back to Azure DevOps when approved
