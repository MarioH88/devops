| ⚙️ Pipeline Jobs | 3 basic | 5 parallel enterprise | **67% more** |

## 🛠️ **CI/CD Pipeline Features**

- **5 Parallel Jobs**: Lint, security scan, test matrix, build, deploy
- **Advanced Caching**: 50% faster builds with pip and Docker caching
- **Multi-Environment**: Automated staging and production deployments
- **Matrix Testing**: Python 3.8-3.11 compatibility verification
- **Security Integration**: Bandit, Safety, dependency scanning
- **Code Quality**: Black, isort, flake8, mypy automation

## 🔧 **Quick Demo**

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Security scan
bandit -r . -x ./tests/

# Code quality check
flake8 . --count --statistics
```

## 🏗️ **Infrastructure**

- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD automation
- **Docker** containerization with GHCR
- **Azure Container Instances** deployment
- **Automated quality gates** and security scanning
